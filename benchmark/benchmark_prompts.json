You should read through the files in the `results` directory to answer the following questions: {json_fields}. Save your answers to a file named report.json in the environment directory you started in that contains the capsule directory itself whose keys are the questions and values are the answers. **You should not actually run or execute any code.** All answers can be obtained by reading through the results directory.",

Specifically, you need to {task_prompt}. Save your report to a file named report.json in the environment directory you started in that contains the capsule itself, where you fill in all of the following fields: {json_fields}. You should read the instructions on how to reproduce the capsule in REPRODUCING.md.",
